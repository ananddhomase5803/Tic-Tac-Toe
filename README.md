🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe in Java

A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using core Java.
This project runs completely in the console, allowing two players to play against each other by entering row and column positions.

🚀 Features

  ✔️ 3x3 game board

  ✔️ Two-player mode (X and O)
  
  ✔️ Input validation to avoid overwriting filled cells
  
  ✔️ Automatic win detection (rows, columns, and diagonals)
  
  ✔️ Detects draw condition
  
  ✔️ Clean and readable Java code


📂 Project Structure

  TicTacToe.java   → Main Java class containing game logic

🧠 How It Works

  The game initializes a blank 3×3 board.
  
  Players take turns entering coordinates.
  
  After every move, the board updates and checks:
  
  Win in any row
  
  Win in any column
  
  Win in both diagonals
  
  If no spaces remain and no one wins → Draw

  Install Java (JDK 8+)
  
  Compile the file:
  
  javac TicTacToe.java


Run:

  java TicTacToe
